Project Link: https://calculator-thegenetic.netlify.app/

**--------Logic--------**

For coding the main calculation section. I have used:
1. First, i have converted the equation i.e. the infix expression to a postfix expression.
2. Then, i have used stack to perform the calcualtion step by step from the obtained postfix expression
3. Then, simple jquery codes to display the obtained result
4. This calcualtor also has the feature of dark mode and light mode which I did by using css and js.
5. It is also responsive for all devices.
